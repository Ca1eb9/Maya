# Maya
Maya is a personal AI project I work on. The project is extremely basic for now. Please read all of the directions below before use.

## Issues
If you see or encounter even a potential bug or issue, please make a [new issue](https://github.com/Ca1eb9/Maya/issues) or type
`-issue` followed by your issue in your Maya application.(`-issue your issue`) When submitting an issue, please include your 
Maya version(left hand corner of Maya app) and your OS. If there is a wrongful intent or entity recognition, that would count as an issue as well.
## Updating
There will be updated versions of Maya released here, however, if you already have any version, your Maya should auto update to the newest version on launch.

## Media Playing
Maya can play any Youtube video you ask it to and play multiple radio stations. To use this feature, you must download and install the well known [VLC media player](https://www.videolan.org/).

## Install
Download the latest version for your OS at this [link](https://github.com/Ca1eb9/Maya/releases). No install is required.

## Use
Please be sure to press "Allow" on all requests of Administrator Privileges from Maya(Maya.exe), Python(Runtime Maya is run on), and on Windows: Windows Script Host(to allow for Maya to auto restart after update), internet firewall, etc. or any other requests if asked. I can guarantee that there is NO malicious software(malware, unwanted software, spyware, etc.) in Maya and its files, so you should not worry about allowing these privileges.

### Abilities
Currently, Maya only has these ablitys:
- Sleep
  
  Ask Maya to sleep and to ignore your future requests until you wake it(wake up)
- Dice
  
  Ask Maya to roll any number of dice(up to 6)
- Remembrance
  
  Ask Maya to remember anything you tell it(specifically future events or things to do on specific dates)
  Ask Maya to remove specific dates in which it has remembered
  Ask Maya to tell you what you have told it to remember on a specific date
- Media Playing
  
  Ask Maya to play any media on Youtube(URL or title)
  - Turn loop of currently playing media on or off
  - Pause or unpause/resume currently playing media
  - Repeat the last played media
  - Skip the currently playing media
  
  Ask Maya to play one of over 8 different genre radio stations(Pop radio, Hip Hop radio, etc.)
  
  Request the currently playing media
  
  Stop the currently playing media("stop the music/radio" specifically due to 'stop' being a broad command)

- Weather
  
  Ask Maya for a good majority of the current weather related details(temperature, wind speed, etc.)

You can talk to Maya both through the Maya textbox in the client or by activating it by speaking "Hey Maya"(Hey Mai * Uh) followed by your request.

## Artificial Intelligence
The plan is to create a conscious/semi-conscious(by definition) AI.
At the moment, Maya only uses machine learning to detect certain intents and extract certain entitys.
Please be patient with potential low-level request recognition.
