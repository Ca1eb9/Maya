# Maya
Maya is a personal AI project I work on. The project is extremely basic for now. Please read all of the directions below before use.

## Issues
If you see or encounter even a potential bug or issue, please make a [new issue](https://github.com/Ca1eb9/Maya/issues) or type
`-issue` followed by your issue in your Maya application. (`-issue your issue`) When submitting an issue, please mention your 
Maya version(left hand corner of Maya) and your OS.

## Updating
There will be updated versions of Maya released here, however, if you already have any version, your Maya should auto update to the newest version on launch.

## Media Playing
Maya can play any Youtube video you ask it to. To use this feature, you must download and install the well known [VLC media player](https://www.videolan.org/).

## Install
Download the latest version for your OS at this [link](https://github.com/Ca1eb9/Maya/releases). No install is required.
